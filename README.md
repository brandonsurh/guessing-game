# guessing-game

This program was created to familiarize myself with Rust by following examples in "The Book".

The Rust Programming Language by by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community:

## How to compile using "cargo":

This requires having cargo installed on your machine (usually installed with Rust).

1. Change directory to path of main.rs.
```bash 
cd guessing_game
```

2. Compile main.rs
```bash 
cargo run
```
If you try to compile using "rustc" there may be dependency issues with crates (ex. rand).
