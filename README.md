# guessing-game

This program was created to familiarize myself in Rust.

## How to compile using "cargo":

This requires having cargo installed on your machine (usually installed with Rust).

1. Change directory to path of main.rs.
```bash 
cd guessing_game
```

2. Compile main.rs
```bash 
cargo run
```
If you try to compile using "rustc" there may be dependency issues with crates (ex. rand).
